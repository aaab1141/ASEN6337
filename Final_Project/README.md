# ASEN 6337 Final_Project Folder

This is the code for the Final Project

## How to Use this?

TBH this will probably be a little annoying but it would be possible to run things if you really wanted too.

### Data

The data file could be found at the link below at the time of this commit. It is a 30GB .tar file so it's chunky. 

### Create Some Training Sets

There are a bunch of different training sets that you could create. There is a .m file for creating each of these training sets. Most of these scripts should check the file structure of your root folder to make sure that the right file structure is there. As they go up in number this gets better. The file structure bugs shouldn't be that annoying though.

Run any file called 'maketrainingX.m'

### Train a Network

Run any of the train network .m files. These should train a network with the specified training set. The file paths again may need some slight tweaking depending on what you want to do. All the train network .m files are essentially the same but just with different training set folder paths or number of epochs or name of the saved network .mat file.

### Think

Now you too can see the results that I saw and think about what they mean.
