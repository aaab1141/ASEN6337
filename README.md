# ASEN 6337 Repo

This is the repository for ASEN 6337. It includes a few things in three main folders.

## Final_Project

The Final Project folder includes the MATLAB code that I wrote for a final project where I used Transfer Learning and MATLAB's Neural Network tools to classify rooftops taken from aerial imagery data into five classes.
